= Getting started with Apache Log4j

Apache Log4j is a framework that helps you understand, what a software system actually does.
Imagine you are joining a new project as a junior developer and you are overwhelmed by the
hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Reading all those lines will cost you a lot of time.
To understand such a system you can connect to it using a debugger and follow every step the system does.
Or you can read a log file: a file, where the system writes information about it's state, what it does
and with what data it currently operates.

This is similar to a debugger, but also has some advantages that a debugger does not have:

You can look into the past. When you write log files for production systems, you can spot errors
that happened, even when they are few days old.
Sometimes, you are also not able to reproduce a very specific error with the debugger, no matter
how accurately a user describes their problem. With well done logs, you may have access to information,
that a user can't tell you.

Frameworks like Log4j don't only allow you to write basic strings to files. Log4j is able
to write to different kinds of outputs, from Console to Queues and even databases.

== What do I need to know?

Logging Frameworks are fundamental, and Log4j is also fundamental. To work with it, you don't require
any special skills except for Java coding skills. If you know Exceptions, basic XML rules (for configuration)
and general Java syntax (Strings, maybe Lambda basics) you are good to go.

== Installing Apache Log4j

The best way to install Log4j is by using a build tool such as Maven or Gradle.
