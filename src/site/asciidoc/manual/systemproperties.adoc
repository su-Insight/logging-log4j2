[#SystemProperties]
== System Properties

The Log4j documentation references a number of System Properties that
can be used to control various aspects of Log4j 2 behavior. How properties
are handled has undergone significant changes in Log4j 3.x so properties
defined for applications using Log4j 2.x may need to be modified to work
with Log4j 3.x.

=== Property Name Aliases

Older versions of Log4j used a different format for property names. Many of these names are still supported via
the use of aliases. Log4j locates all files named `META-INF/log4j2-propertyMapping.json` in which the old property
names are mapped to their new counterparts. Applications may make use of this by creating a file with the same path
in a jar or classes folder that is on the class path. Note that these files are read when Log4j initializes and are
used to remap settings located in a Properties object managed by a PropertySource, such as the System Properties or
environment variables.

=== Application Scoped Properties and Property Names

Log4j is designed to allow multiple applications to reside in the same JVM
and allow each to have their own set of Loggers and logging configuration,
so it is somewhat logical that the applications may want to take advantage
of Log4j functionality in different ways. Log4j achieves this through the
use of the LoggerContext. A LoggerContext is the anchor point for the configuration
and all the Loggers in the application. However, how an application is assigned its
own LoggerContext depends greatly on the environment it is running in.

In a typical web container, such as Tomcat or Jetty, the application server runs
in its own ClassLoader and then creates a separate child ClassLoader for each application.
In this environment, Log4j's default ContextSelector, ClassLoaderContextSelector, works
well by associating the LoggerContext with the current ClassLoader. However,
JEE environments typically will need to use the JndiContextSelector to locate the
LoggerContext by the JNDI name associated with the application.

So how does this relate to application scoped properties? The application will need to
provide a file containing the application specific properties, locate them as
system properties or environment variables, or in Log4j's system scoped properties files.
This is achieved using the following rules:

1. In general, Log4j properties are named using the scheme ``log4j2.{contextName}.{componentName}.{key}``.
A contextName of ``\*`` indicates the property is system wide. For example, the Log4j configuration file
could be identified as ``log4j2.*.Configuration.file`` as the system wide value while
``log4j2.PaymentUI.Configuration.file`` would only apply to the application with the context name
of PaymentUI. Note that property names are case sensitive.
2. Applications that use the ClassLoaderContextSelector will typically have unpredictable names and so
cannot be configured as system properties or in Log4j's ``log4j2.components.properties`` or
``log4j2.components.json`` files. Instead, they should be placed into a file named
``META-INF/log4j2.context.properties`` or ``META-INF/log4j2.context.json`` in the classpath
of the ClassLoader for the application. In this case the properties should be specified only as
``{componentName}.{key}``, leaving off the leading "log4j2" and contextName since these properties
only apply to the context in which they are located.
3. While applications that use names to identify the LoggerContext can also use the ``META-INF/log4j2.context``
files, generally this is not very useful since they may share ClassLoaders. Instead, they can
use files named ``META-INF/log4j2.{contextName}.properties`` or ``META-INF/log4j2.{contextName}.json``.
Like the properties specified in item 2 above, these properties must also specify their properties as
``{componentName}.{key}`` leaving off the leading "log4j2" and contextName.

=== Custom Property Sources

Properties are located using PropertySources. This system is extensible
and is enabled through the
link:../log4j-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/util/PropertySource.html[`PropertySource`]
interface. Additional property source classes can be added through the
standard `ServiceLoader` mechanism in Java SE.


Properties can be overridden by sources with a lower number priority
(e.g.., -100 comes before 100). The following sources are all available
by default:

.PropertySource priorities and descriptions
[cols="2,1,5",frame="all"]
|===
|Source |Priority |Description

|Spring Boot Properties
|-100
|This property source is enabled only if the Java application uses Spring Boot and the
`log4j-spring` module is present. It resolves properties using a Spring
link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html[Environment].

|System Properties
|0
|All properties can be set using normal system
property patterns. These have the lowest numerical priority among commonly available property sources
and can override included `log4j2.component.properties` files or environment variables. If a `log4j2.system.properties` file is available on the classpath its contents are
sourced into Java system properties at Log4j startup.

|Environment Variables
|100
|Environment variables are all prefixed
with `LOG4J_`, are in all caps, and words are all separated by
underscores. Only this naming scheme is support for environment
variables as there were no old naming schemes to maintain compatibility
with.

|`log4j2.context.json` or `log4j2.{contextName}.json`
|110
|Properties in these files only apply to the specific LoggerContext to which they are bound, either by name or ClassLoader.

|`log4j2.context.properties' or `log4j2.{contextName}.properties`
|120
|Properties in these files only apply to the specific LoggerContext to which they are bound, either by name or ClassLoader.

|`log4j2.component.properties` file
|200
|Including this file on the classpath can be used as an alternative to providing properties as system
properties. This is the property source with highest numerical priority and can be used to provide
default values that can be overridden by the system administrator.

The table below lists these properties that are included as part of the Log4j API along with their
default value and a description of what they control. The component identifies tha category the property
fits into, the alias includes values from Log4j 2.x that are still allowed, the Scope identifies whether
the setting may be applied system wide and/or to a LoggerContext.

|log4j2.simplelogShowShortLogname, LOG4J_SIMPLELOG_SHOW_SHORT_LOGNAME
|System
|true
|If `true`, only the last component of a logger name is included in SimpleLogger log messages. (E.g.,
if the logger name is "mycompany.myproject.mycomponent", only "mycomponent" is logged.

|SimpleLogger
|showDateTime
|log4j2.simplelogShowdatetime, LOG4J_SIMPLELOG_SHOWDATETIME
|System
|false
|If `true`, SimpleLogger log messages contain timestamp information.

|SimpleLogger

|System
|ERROR
|Default level for new SimpleLogger instances.

|SimpleLogger
|statusLoggerLevel
|log4j2.simplelogStatusLoggerLevel, LOG4J_SIMPLELOG_STATUS_LOGGER_LEVEL
|System
|ERROR
|This property is used to control the initial StatusLogger level, and can be overridden in code by calling
`StatusLogger.getLogger() .setLevel(someLevel)`. Note that the
StatusLogger level is only used to determine the status log output level
until a listener is registered. In practice, a listener is registered
when a configuration is found, and from that point onwards, status
messages are only sent to the listeners (depending on their
statusLevel).

|StatusLogger
|debug
|log4j2.debug, LOG4J_DEBUG
|System/Application
|false
|Log4j2 will print all
internal logging to the console if system property `log4j2.debug` is either
defined empty or its value equals to `true` (ignoring case).

`java.text.SimpleDateFormat` for supported formats.

|StatusLogger
|defaultLevel
|log4j2.defaultStatusLevel, LOG4J_DEFAULT_STATUS_LEVEL
|System
|ERROR
|The StatusLogger logs events that occur in the logging system to the console. During configuration,
AbstractConfiguration registers a StatusConsoleListener with the StatusLogger that may redirect status log
events from the default console output to a file. The listener also
supports fine-grained filtering. This system property specifies the
default status log level for the listener to use if the configuration
does not specify a status level.

Note: this property is used by the log4j-core implementation only after a configuration file has been found.

|StatusLogger
|level
|log4j2.statusLoggerLevel, LOG4J_STATUS_LOGGER_LEVEL
|System
|WARN
|The initial "listenersLevel" of the StatusLogger. If StatusLogger listeners are added, the
"listenerLevel" is changed to that of the most verbose listener. If any listeners are
registered, the listenerLevel is used to quickly determine if an interested listener exists.

By default, StatusLogger listeners are added when a configuration is
found and by the JMX StatusLoggerAdmin MBean. For example, if a
configuration contains `<Configuration status="trace">`, a listener with
statusLevel TRACE is registered and the StatusLogger listenerLevel is
set to TRACE, resulting in verbose status messages displayed on the
console.

If no listeners are registered, the listenersLevel is not used, and the
StatusLogger output level is determined by
`StatusLogger.getLogger().getLevel()` (see property
`org.apache.logging.log4j.simplelog .StatusLogger.level`).

|ThreadContext
|enable
|
|System
|true
|If `false`,the ThreadContext stack and map are disabled. (May be ignored if a
custom ThreadContext map is specified.) NOTE - this setting changed from `log4j2.disableThreadContext`
in 2.x so cannot be mapped to 3.0 since it has the opposite meaning.

|ThreadContext
|enableStack
|
|System
|false
|If `false`, the ThreadContext stack is disabled. NOTE - this setting changed from
`log4j2.disableThreadContextStack` in 2.x so cannot be mapped to 3.0 since it has the opposite meaning.

|ThreadContext
|enableMap
|
|System
|false
|If `false`, the ThreadContext map is disabled. (May be ignored if a custom ThreadContext map is specified.)
NOTE - this setting changed from `log4j2.disableThreadContextMap` in 2.x so cannot be mapped to 3.0
since it has the opposite meaning.

|ThreadContext
|garbageFree
|log4j2.garbagefreeThreadContextMap, LOG4J_GARBAGEFREE_THREAD_CONTEXT_MAP
|System
|false
|Specify "true" to make the ThreadContext map garbage-free.

|ThreadContext
|mapClass
|log4j2.threadContextMap, LOG4J_THREAD_CONTEXT_MAP
|System
|
|Fully specified
class name of a custom `ThreadContextMap` implementation class.

|ThreadContext
|mapInheritable
|log4j2.isThreadContextMapInheritable, LOG4J_IS_THREAD_CONTEXT_MAP_INHERITABLE
|System
|false
|If `true` use a `InheritableThreadLocal` to implement the ThreadContext map. Otherwise, use a plain `ThreadLocal`.
(May be ignored if a custom ThreadContext map is specified.)

|Unbox
|ringBufferSize
|log4j2.unboxRingbufferSize, LOG4J_UNBOX_RINGBUFFER_SIZE
|System
|32
|The `org.apache.logging.log4j.util.Unbox` utility manages a small
thread-local ring buffer of StringBuilders. Each time one of the `box()`
methods is called, the next slot in the ring buffer is used, until the
ring buffer is full and the first slot is reused. By default the Unbox
ring buffer has 32 slots, so user code can have up to 32 boxed
primitives in a single logger call.

If more slots are required, set system property
`Unbox.ringBufferSize` to the desired ring buffer size. Note that
the specified number will be rounded up to the nearest power of 2.


|Web
|isWebApp
|log4j2.isWebapp, LOG4J_IS_WEBAPP
|System
|true if `Servlet` class on class path
|This system property can be used to force Log4j 2 to behave as if it is part of a web application (when true) or
as if it is not part of a web application (when false).
