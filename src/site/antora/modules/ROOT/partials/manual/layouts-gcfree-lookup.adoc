Encoding the output of a lookup is garbage-free, but executing the lookup might not be.
For instance, even though xref:manual/lookups.adoc#DateLookup[the `date` lookup] allocates a new `String` for each invocation, adding `${date:YYYY-MM-dd}` is garbage-free, because it will be expanded at configuration time, that is, only once.
Whereas adding `$${date:YYYY-MM-dd}` is not, since it will be expanded for each log event.
See xref:manual/configuration.adoc#property-substitution[property substitution] for details.
