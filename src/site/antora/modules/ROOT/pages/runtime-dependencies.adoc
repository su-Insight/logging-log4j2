= Runtime Dependencies

Some Log4J features depend on external libraries. This page lists the required and optional dependencies.

As of version 2.10.0, the Log4j API is a named Java module (with a `module-info.java`). Since version 2.21.0, all the remaining artifacts are named modules. The characteristics of the modules are:

[options="header"]
|===
| Artifact Name | Module Name | Module Characteristics

| log4j-api
| org.apache.logging.log4j
| Module Directive	Notes
exports org.apache.logging.log4j
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.message
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.simple
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.spi
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.spi
exports org.apache.logging.log4j.util	Some classes in this package are used by the logging implementation and should be considered private. The module info definition may be modified in the future to export these only to the logging implementation.
uses org.apache.logging.log4j.spi.Provider	Service that must be provided by the logging implementation.

|===

As of version 2.9.1, Log4j supports Java 9 but will still work in Java 7 or 8. In this version, log4j-api is packaged as a multi-release jar and supports the use of the StackWalker and Process APIs.

As of version 2.4, Log4J requires Java 7.

Log4j version 2.3 and older require Java 6.

== log4j-api

The Log4J xref:log4j-api.adoc[API] module has no external dependencies.

== log4j-core
