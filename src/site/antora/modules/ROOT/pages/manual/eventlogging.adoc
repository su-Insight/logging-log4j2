= Event Logger

The `EventLogger` class provides a mechanism for logging significant events 
in an application using structured data. This approach is beneficial for 
tracking user actions, monitoring system behavior, and debugging issues.

Theoretically, every `Logger` can be used to perform this kind of action;
however, the `EventLogger` class provides a shortcut to log events with structured data
since it allows for a static method to log events.

== Advantages of Structured Logging

Structured logging means events Log4j records events with detailed and structured information.
That way, logs are easier to read and process. They provide better context and
are also more consistent than plain text logs.

== Integration with Syslog

Log4j complies with Syslogs RFC5424 standard. 
This feature allows for easy integration with existing log management and monitoring systems.

== Example Configuration

To configure Log4j to output logs in Syslog (RFC5424) format, one needs to use the link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/StructuredDataLayout.html[`StructuredDataLayout`] layout. 
Developers can use the following configuration to log events to a local Syslog server:

[source, xml]
----
<Appenders>
    <Syslog name="Syslog" host="localhost" port="514"> <1>
        <StructuredDataLayout complete="true" /> <2>
    </Syslog>
</Appenders>

<Loggers>
    <Logger name="MyApp" level="info" additivity="false">
        <AppenderRef ref="Syslog"/>
    </Logger>
</Loggers>
----
<1> The `Syslog` appender sends logs to a local Syslog server.
<2> The `StructuredDataLayout` layout formats logs in RFC5424 format.

Of course, sending logs to a Syslog server is unnecessary. 
Developers can use the `StructuredDataLayout` layout with any other appender, such as `FileAppender` or `ConsoleAppender`.

As an example, the output could look like this:

[source, text]
----
<165>1 2024-05-16T12:34:56.789Z myapp MyApp - ID47 [transfer@12345 toAccount="123456" fromAccount="654321" amount="1000"] User 654321 has transferred 1000 to account 123456
----

== Using the `EventLogger`

The `EventLogger` class provides a simple way to log structured events.
It uses the `StructuredDataMessage` class to create structured log messages.

Assume a simple application that performs funds transfers between accounts.
This application should send a certain amount of funds from one account to another and log the event.

The account class is defined as follows, with a unique ID and a balance:

[source, java]
----
class Account {
    private String id;
    private long balance;
    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
----

The `transfer()` method transfers funds between two accounts and logs the event.
It needs to take two accounts and the amount to transfer as parameters.

Apart from the key-value pairs provided in the map of the `StructuredDataMessage,`
the `StructuredDataMessage` also takes a unique ID, a free-form message, and a type as parameters.

The free-form message is a human-readable description of the event. 
This message is good for operators who need to understand the event quickly, 
but not so much for automated processing.

[source, java]
----
public static String transferFunds(Account toAccount, Account fromAccount, long amount) {
    toAccount.deposit(amount);
    fromAccount.withdraw(amount);

    // Create a unique ID for the transaction
    String confirm = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    String freeFormMessage = "User " + fromAccount.getId() + " has transferred " + amount + " to account " + toAccount.getId(); <1>

    // Create the StructuredDataMessage
    StructuredDataMessage msg = new StructuredDataMessage(confirm, freeFormMessage, "transfer"); <2>
    msg.put("toAccount", toAccount.getId()); <3>
    msg.put("fromAccount", fromAccount.getId());
    msg.put("amount", amount);

    // Log the event
    EventLogger.logEvent(msg); <4>

    return confirm;
}
----
<1> The free-form message is a human-readable description of the event.
<2> The `StructuredDataMessage` constructor takes an ID, the free-form message, and a type.
<3> Developers can add key-value pairs to the message.
<4> The `EventLogger` logs the event.

That way, the `transferFunds()` method logs the event with structured data
by using the `EventLogger`.

== Web Application Example

In a web application, developers can use a servlet filter to populate the 
`ThreadContext` map with data related to the request.

The following example demonstrates how a `Filter` could investigate the request
and populate the `ThreadContext` map with data such as the user's IP address,
the user's login ID, the server's hostname, the product name, the locale, and the timezone.

[source, java]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.ThreadContext;
import org.apache.commons.lang.time.DateUtils;

import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.TimeZone;

public class RequestFilter implements Filter {
    private FilterConfig filterConfig;
    private static String TZ_NAME = "timezoneOffset";

    // Other methods ommitted for brevity

    /**
     * Sample filter that populates the MDC on every request.
     */
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain filterChain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest request = (HttpServletRequest)servletRequest;
        
        ThreadContext.put("ipAddress", request.getRemoteAddr()); <1>

        HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);
        if (session != null) {
            // Assuming, an authentication filter has already populated the loginId in the session
            String loginId = (String)session.getAttribute("loginId");
            if (loginId != null) {
                ThreadContext.put("loginId", loginId);
            }
        }

        ThreadContext.put("hostname", servletRequest.getServerName());
        ThreadContext.put("productName", filterConfig.getInitParameter("ProductName"));
        ThreadContext.put("locale", servletRequest.getLocale().getDisplayName());
        ThreadContext.put("timezone", TimeZone.getDefault().getDisplayName());

        filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);
        ThreadContext.clear();
    }
}
----
<1> The `doFilter()` method populates the `ThreadContext` map with data related to the request.

The `Filter` needs to be registered in your `web.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<filter>
    <filter-name>RequestFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.example.RequestFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>ProductName</param-name>
        <param-value>YourProductName</param-value>
    </init-param>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>RequestFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern> <1>
</filter-mapping>
----
<1> The `RequestFilter` is mapped to all requests.

Eventually, a `Servlet` or any other related class, such as a Spring Controller, can be used to log events with structured data. 
The following example uses a `Servlet` to call the `EventLogger` and log a user action.

[source, java]
----
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class UserActionServlet extends HttpServlet {
    
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
        String action = request.getParameter("action");
        String details = request.getParameter("details");

        // Perform and log the user action
        String message = "User " + userId + " performed action: " + action;
        StructuredDataMessage msg = new StructuredDataMessage(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), message, "userAction"); <1>
        msg.put("userId", userId);
        msg.put("action", action);
        msg.put("details", details);

        // Log the event
        EventLogger.logEvent(msg); 

        // Respond to the client
        response.getWriter().write("Action logged successfully");
    }
}
----
<1> `userAction` is the name of the current transaction

That way, not only the data provided to the `EventLogger` is used, but also all the 
data populated in the `ThreadContext` map is included in the log message.

== Benefits of Structured Logging

1. **Improved Readability and Context:** 
   Structured logs include detailed information, making them easier to understand and analyze.
2. **Better for Automated Processing:**
   Structured logs are easily parsed by existing log management tools.
3. **Consistency:**
   Structured logging enforces a consistent format, helping to identify patterns in logs.
4. **Performance Optimization:** 
   Structured messages are - as all messages - only constructed when necessary, keeping overhead low.
