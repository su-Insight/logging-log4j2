= JMX
Remko Popma <remkop@yahoo.com>

Log4j 2 has built-in support for JMX. The StatusLogger, ContextSelector,
and all LoggerContexts, LoggerConfigs and Appenders are instrumented
with MBeans and can be remotely monitored and controlled.

Also included is a simple client GUI that can be used to monitor the
StatusLogger output, as well as to remotely reconfigure Log4j with a
different configuration file, or to edit the current configuration
directly.

[#Enabling_JMX]
== Enabling JMX

JMX support is enabled by default. When Log4j initializes, the
StatusLogger, ContextSelector, and all LoggerContexts, LoggerConfigs and
Appenders are instrumented with MBeans. To disable JMX completely, and
prevent these MBeans from being created, specify system property
`log4j2.disableJmx` to `true` when you start the Java VM.

[#Local]
== Local Monitoring and Management

To perform local monitoring you don't need to specify any system
properties. The JConsole tool that is included in the Java JDK can be
used to monitor your application. Start JConsole by typing
`$JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole` in a command shell. For more details,
see Oracle's documentation on
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html[how
to use JConsole].

[#Remote]
== Remote Monitoring and Management

To enable monitoring and management from remote systems, set the
following system property when starting the Java VM.

`com.sun.management.jmxremote.port=portNum`

In the property above, `portNum` is the port number through which you
want to enable JMX RMI connections.

For more details, see Oracle's documentation on
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdenl[Remote
Monitoring and Management].

[#RMI_GC]
== RMI impact on Garbage Collection

Be aware that RMI by default triggers a full GC every hour. See the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/sunrmiproperties.html[Oracle
documentation] for the `sun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval` and
`sun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval` properties. The default value of both
properties is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour). Before Java 6, it was one
minute.

The two sun.rmi arguments reflect whether your JVM is running in server
or client mode. If you want to modify the GC interval time it may be
best to specify both properties to ensure the argument is picked up by
the JVM.

An alternative may be to disable explicit calls to `System.gc()`
altogether with `-XX:+DisableExplicitGC`, or (if you are using the CMS
or G1 collector) add `-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent` to ensure the
full GCs are done concurrently in parallel with your application instead
of forcing a stop-the-world collection.

[#Log4j_MBeans]
== Log4j Instrumented Components

The best way to find out which methods and attributes of the various  Log4j components are accessible via JMX is to look at the `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.jmx` package contents in the `log4j-core` artifact or by exploring directly in JConsole.

The screenshot below shows the Log4j MBeans in JConsole.

MBeans tab]

[#ClientGUI]
== Client GUI

https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j-jmx-gui[The Apache Log4j JMX GUI] is a basic client GUI that can be used to monitor the `StatusLogger` output and to remotely modify the Log4j configuration.
The client GUI can be run as a stand-alone application or as a JConsole plug-in.
