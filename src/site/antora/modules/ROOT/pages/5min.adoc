[#what]
== What is logging and Log4j?

Logging is the action of publishing diagnostics information at certain points of a program execution:

[source,java]
----
private void truncateTable(String tableName) {
    System.out.format("[WARN] Truncating table `%s`!%n", tableName);
    db.truncate(tableName);
}
----

This provides observability into an application's runtime. (See {logging-services-url}/what-is-logging.html[What is logging?] page for a longer read.)

But we can do way better than a `printf()` statement!

* Enhance the message with additional information (timestamp, class & method name, line number, host, severity, etc.)
* Write the message in a different way, using a different **layout** (CSV, JSON, etc.)
* Write the message to a different medium, using a different **appender** (file, socket, database, queue, etc.)
* Write only some of the messages, using a **filter** (e.g. filter by severity, content, etc.)

Log4j is versatile, industrial-grade Java logging framework delivering all these and more in one product.
It is essentially composed of a **logging API** and its **implementation**:

Log4j API::
The logging API your code (programmatically) logs through.
This needs to be available at compile-time and no configuration is needed.

Log4j Core::
The logging implementation which is responsible for filtering, routing, encoding, and appending log events.
This needs to be available at runtime and configured by the user.

[#logging]
== How do I log using Log4j?

Add the `log4j-api` dependency to your application:

[tabs]
====
Maven::
+
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<project>

  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-bom</artifactId>
        <version>{log4j-core-version}</version>
        <scope>import</scope>
        <type>pom</type>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>

  <dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j-api</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependency>

</project>
----

Gradle::
+
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
  implementation platform('org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-bom:{log4j-core-version}')
  implementation 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api'
}
----
====

And start logging:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;

public class DbTableService {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger(); // <1>

    public void truncateTable(String tableName) throws IOException {
        LOGGER.warn("truncating table `{}`", tableName); // <2>
        db.truncate(tableName);
    }

}
----
<1> This is a thread-safe, reusable `Logger` instance.
The associated class will be captured at initialization â€“ no need for a `getLogger(DbTableService.class)`.
<2> The parameter placeholders `{}` in the message will be automatically replaced with the value of `tableName` and the generated **log event** will be enriched with **level** (i.e., `WARN`), timestamp, class & method name, line number, and several other information.

Make sure to log exceptions that have diagnostics value:

[source,java]
----
LOGGER.warn("truncating table `{}`", tableName);
try {
    db.truncate(tableName);
} catch (IOException exception) {
    LOGGER.error("failed truncating table `{}`", tableName, exception); // <1>
    throw new IOException("failed truncating table: " + tableName, exception);
}
----
<1> Notice the `error()` method?
Yup, the level is set to `ERROR`.
+
What about the `exception` in the last argument?
Wait a second!
There is one placeholder in the format (i.e., `{}`), but there are two parameters passed in arguments: `tableName` and `exception`!
What the heck?
Yep, you guessed it right!
Log4j API will attach the last extra argument of type `Throwable` in a separate field to the generated log event.

[#pitfalls]
=== Common pitfalls

There are several widespread bad practices.
Let's try to walk through the most common ones.

[#pitfal-toString]
==== Don't use `toString()`

* [ ] `Object#toString()` is redundant in arguments
+
[source,java]
----
/* BAD! */ LOGGER.info("userId: {}", userId.toString());
----

* [x] Underlying message type and layout will deal with arguments
+
[source,java]
----
/* GOOD */ LOGGER.info("userId: {}", userId);
----

[#pitfall-exception]
==== Pass exception as the last extra argument

Using `Throwable#printStackTrace()` or `Throwable#getMessage()` while logging?
Please, don't!

* [ ] Don't call `Throwable#printStackTrace()`.
This not only circumvents the logging, but can also leak sensitive information!
+
[source,java]
----
/* BAD! */ exception.printStackTrace();
----

* [ ] Don't use `Throwable#getMessage()`.
This prevents the log event from getting enriched with the exception.
+
[source,java]
----
/* BAD! */ LOGGER.info("failed", exception.getMessage());
/* BAD! */ LOGGER.info("failed for user ID `{}`: {}", userId, exception.getMessage());
----

* [ ] This bloats the log message with duplicate exception message
+
[source,java]
----
/* BAD! */ LOGGER.info("failed for user ID `{}`: {}", userId, exception.getMessage(), exception);
----

* [x] Pass exception as the last extra argument
+
[source,java]
----
/* GOOD */ LOGGER.error("failed", exception);
/* GOOD */ LOGGER.error("failed for user ID `{}`", userId, exception);
----

[#pitfal-concat]
==== Don't use string concatenation

If you are using `String` concatenation while logging, you are doing something very wrong and dangerous!

* [ ] Circumvents the handling of arguments by message type and layout.
More importantly, this code is prone to attacks!
Imagine `userId` being provided by user with the following content:
`placeholders for non-existing args to trigger failure: {} {} \{dangerousLookup}`
+
[source,java]
----
/* BAD! */ LOGGER.info("failed for user ID: " + userId);
----

* [x] Use message parameters
+
[source,java]
----
/* GOOD */ LOGGER.info("failed for user ID `{}`", userId);
----

[#config-app]
== How do I configure Log4j to run my **application**?

Your code logs through a logging API.
So your dependencies and their dependencies too.
While deploying your application, you need to provide a **logging implementation** along with its configuration to consume all generated log events.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Are you implementing not an **application**, but a **library**?
Please skip to the xref:#config-lib[] instead.
====

Add the `log4j-core` **runtime** dependency to your application:

[tabs]
====
Maven::
+
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<project>

  <!-- Assuming you already have the `dependencyManagement > dependencies > dependency` entry for `log4j-bom` -->

  <dependency>

    <!-- The logging implementation (i.e., Log4j Core) -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope><!--1-->
    </dependency>

    <!-- Log4j JSON-encoding support -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j-layout-template-json</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope><!--1-->
    </dependency>

    <!-- SLF4J-to-Log4j bridge --><!--2-->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-slf4j2-impl</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope><!--1-->
    </dependency>

  </dependency>

</project>
----

Gradle::
+
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {

  // Assuming you already have the `implementation platform(...)` entry for `log4j-bom`

  // The logging implementation (i.e., Log4j Core)
  runtimeOnly 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core' // <1>

  // Log4j JSON-encoding support
  runtimeOnly 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-layout-template-json' // <1>

  // SLF4J-to-Log4j bridge // <2>
  runtimeOnly 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl' // <1>

}
----
====
<1> Note that the logging implementation and bridges are only needed at runtime!
<2> SLF4J is another widely used logging API.
`log4j-slf4j2-impl` forwards SLF4J calls to Log4j API, which effectively gets processed by Log4j Core too.

Now it is time to configure Log4j and instruct how the log events should be routed.
Save the following XML document to `src/**main**/resources/log4j2.xml`:

.An example `src/**main**/resources/log4j2.xml`
[source,xml]

<6> Unless specified otherwise, log events will be forwarded to the `console` appender defined earlier.

You are strongly advised to use a different Log4j configuration for tests.
Continue to xref:#config-test[]

[#config-lib]
== How do I configure Log4j for my **library**?

Unlike applications, libraries should be logging implementation agnostic.
That is, **libraries should log through a logging API, but leave the decision of the logging implementation to the application**.
That said, libraries need a logging implementation while running their tests.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Are you implementing not a **library**, but an **application**?
Please skip to the xref:#config-app[] instead.
====

Add the `log4j-core` **test** dependency to your library:

<2> SLF4J is another widely used logging API.

Next, you need a `src/**test**/resources/log4j2-test.xml`.
See xref:#config-test[]

[#config-test]
== How do I configure Log4j for tests?

For tests, prefer a human-readable layout with increased verbosity.
